# Postgres GUI

Postgres GUI is a powerful and intuitive GUI client for PostgreSQL, built with RemixJS. It features authentication via Logto, which can be self-hosted or used via the cloud. Users can also opt to run the app locally without authentication. Inspired by Supabase's table editor UI, Postgres GUI aims to provide a seamless experience for managing PostgreSQL databases.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Easily integrate with Logto for secure access.
- **Table Editor**: Intuitive UI for managing PostgreSQL tables.
- **Customizable**: Use with or without authentication.
